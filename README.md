### Hi there 👋

My name is Slava Razum. I'm developer from Ukraine, Kharkiv. All my life I wanted to create projects that could make our lives more interesting and happier 😊

Today, the internet and app creation seems to be the best way to bring improvements to as many people as possible.

I'm a huge fan of concise and neat software solutions.
My deep conviction is – that truly user-friendly solutions should be created with developer-friendly tools.
Thus, the main development stack became: [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [VueJS](https://vuejs.com), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

I am currently in the city of Dnipro with my life partner [Anastasiia Yermolaeva](https://twitter.com/yermolaevan). We fled from our hometown Kharkiv and decided to create **Qruto** team. Now we need help to be able to continue working on the projects that we publish. We have created a sponsorship page with more information and we would appreciate it if you would take a moment to visit it.
